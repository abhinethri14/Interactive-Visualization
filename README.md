# Interactive-Visualization
Performed Data analysis on Australian Open Tennis for 11 years i.e. from 2004 to 2014 (Men Only).
Since the data provided has lot of information, it requires thorough analysis of the data. 
For analyzing the dataset, I have used Informaticaâ€™s Rev tool and Rstudio.
For the visualization, I have used JavaScript and D3 library. Text Editor used is Sublime.
